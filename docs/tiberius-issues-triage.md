# Tiberius Open Issues — Categorization for mssql-tiberius-bridge Triage

Source: https://github.com/prisma/tiberius/issues (101 open issues, fetched 2026-05-09)

This document categorizes every open issue in `prisma/tiberius` to determine which ones may also exist in `mssql-tiberius-bridge` (which sits on Microsoft's `mssql-tds`, not on tiberius's own protocol implementation). For each category we note:
- **Likely status in bridge**: how the bridge probably behaves (based on its architecture: it wraps `mssql-tds` and exposes a tiberius-compatible facade).
- **Action**: whether to file a duplicate in bridge + attempt a fix.

> **Architecture reminder**: The bridge does **not** inherit tiberius's protocol bugs. Bugs in `src/tds/codec/...` of tiberius are most likely *not* present in the bridge because we use a different wire-protocol implementation. However, **API-surface gaps** (missing methods, missing trait impls, ergonomics) and **feature gaps** (transactions, prepared statements, AAD variants, etc.) are very likely shared.

## Triage Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 | Bridge unaffected — tiberius-internal bug or already handled by `mssql-tds`. No action. |
| 🟡 | Possibly affected — needs hands-on repro in bridge. |
| 🔴 | Almost certainly affected — file duplicate + fix. |
| ⚪ | Not actionable — usage question, unrelated, or invalid. No action. |
| 🔵 | Feature request — file as feature in bridge if aligned with roadmap. |

---

## A. Wire-Protocol / Decoder Bugs (in tiberius's `src/tds/codec/...`)

These are bugs in tiberius's TDS implementation. The bridge uses `mssql-tds`, an entirely separate parser, so most are **not** present.

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 418 | Display impl for PacketSize/Database EnvChange shows old/new swapped | 🟢 | — | tiberius-internal log formatting bug. mssql-tds has its own EnvChange impl. |
| 410 | BCP failure when DATE column precedes TIME column | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | tiberius-only BCP encoder bug. Bridge has no `bulk_insert` yet anyway. |
| 368 | Negative Numeric Floats sign issue (`-17.-80`) | ✅ | regression test in PR [#51](../../pull/51) | **Repro**: did we already fix this? Numeric Display in `DecimalParts`. Worth a regression test. |
| 316 | Panic reading datetime field with date < 1900 (overflow in `time` feature) | ✅ | regression test in PR [#51](../../pull/51) | **Repro**: try with `chrono`. mssql-tds may have same overflow. |
| 325 | UTF-16 error on broken characters | 🟡 | tracked in [#90](../../issues/90) | **Repro**: check `to_utf8_string` on `SqlString` for replacement-char fallback. |
| 322 | Bulk insert large varchar/nvarchar fails (BCP colid 8) | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | tiberius BCP-only; bridge has no bulk_insert. |
| 358 | `bulk_insert` does not support Money MS SQL data type | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | tiberius-only. Money/SmallMoney *are* readable in bridge. |
| 370 | (n/a placeholder) | — | — | — |
| 211 | Panic from `try_get` (unwrap path) | ✅ | [#42](../../issues/42) (PR [#43](../../pull/43)) | **Repro**: bridge `Row::try_get` shouldn't panic on type mismatch. |
| 263 | Cannot interpret `I16(None)` as `i32` | ⚪ | bridge `FromSql for i32` already widens from `SmallInt`/`TinyInt`; null via `Option<i32>` | **Repro**: bridge `FromSql for i32` — does it accept SmallInt(None)? Likely improvement. |
| 226 | Performance: handling buffers in `plp.rs` | 🟢 | — | tiberius-only PLP decoder; mssql-tds is separate. |

## B. TLS / Encryption Issues

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 412 | TDS 8.0 and "Strict" encryption option | ✅ | [#62](../../issues/62) — Strict encryption wired | Feature gap. mssql-tds may already do TDS 7.4 encryption; check if it speaks 8.0/Strict. File as feature. |
| 412 | (same) | ✅ | [#62](../../issues/62) — Strict encryption wired | — |
| 327 | `UnsupportedCertVersion` with rustls | 🟢 | — | tiberius-rustls bug. Bridge uses native-tls. |
| 320 | TLS handshake stalls when `EncryptionLevel::Off` | 🟡 | tracked in [#89](../../issues/89) | **Repro**: connect with `EncryptionLevel::Off` in bridge — does it skip handshake? |
| 305 | Unencrypted traffic despite `encrypt=true` due to TLS feature flags disablement | 🟢 | — | tiberius feature-flag config bug. Bridge's encryption is unconditional. |
| 364 | macOS 15 + SQL Server 2014 doesn't work (rustls/vendored-openssl) | ⚪ | out-of-scope (SQL Server 2014 — unsupported) | **Repro**: try bridge against SQL Server 2014. native-tls may behave differently. |
| 274 | TLS handshake EOF | 🟡 | tracked in [#89](../../issues/89) | **Repro**: similar — try basic connect with bridge against the user's reported config. |
| 323 | Failing to connect with TLS (rustls compile errors) | 🟢 | — | tiberius rustls feature-set issue; N/A. |
| 218 | tiberius 0.9 keep crashing on macOS | ⚪ | out-of-scope (old tiberius version) | Old version; tiberius-internal. |
| 340 | Setting `HostNameInCertificate` property | ✅ | [#47](../../issues/47) (PR [#50](../../pull/50)) — `Config::host_name_in_certificate` | Feature: bridge could expose `Config::host_name_in_certificate`. |
| 224 | `danger_accept_invalid_hostnames` + `danger_accept_invalid_certs` | 🟡 | tracked in [#48](../../issues/48) — blocked on mssql-tds | Bridge already has `trust_cert` (skip verify). Hostname-only skip is a separate variant. |
| 381 | openssl support (TLS 1.0 for old SQL Server) | ⚪ | [#70](../../issues/70) closed wontfix — only legacy SQL Server (≤2012) needs TLS<1.2 | mssql-tds uses native-tls (which on macOS uses SecureTransport, on Linux uses openssl). May already support TLS 1.0. |

## C. Authentication

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 407 | sspi-rs for SSPI NTLM on Linux/macOS without Kerberos | 🟡 | tracked in [#66](../../issues/66) | Bridge currently does Kerberos via libgssapi dlopen on Linux. NTLM-on-Linux is a real gap. |
| 343 | Panic in libgssapi when using Integrated Security (Rust 1.78) | ⚪ | bridge libgssapi already includes upstream fix | **Repro**: bridge's libgssapi version — verify it includes the fix referenced (estokes/libgssapi#23). |
| 283 | Build problems with `Auth::Integrated` on CI | 🟢 | — | tiberius-feature build issue. Bridge gates differently. |
| 276 | GSS-NTLMSSP instead of Kerberos on Linux | 🟡 | tracked in [#66](../../issues/66) | Same as 407 — NTLM-via-GSSAPI. |
| 175 | Is Azure SQL/AAD supported? | ✅ | `AuthMethod::aad_token` (PR [#26](../../pull/26)) | Already done — bridge has `AuthMethod::aad_token` (PR #26). |
| 97 | WindowsAuth should be available in Linux | 🟡 | tracked in [#66](../../issues/66) | Same theme as #407/#276. Bridge uses libgssapi for Kerberos. NTLM gap. |
| 333 | Connection failure with special-character password | ✅ | regression test in PR [#51](../../pull/51) | **Repro**: try special chars in `AuthMethod::sql_server`. Likely fine since we don't ADO-parse. |

## D. Bulk Insert / BCP (entire feature missing in bridge)

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 410 | BCP date+time column-order failure | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | (covered above) |
| 358 | Money in bulk_insert | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | (covered above) |
| 352 | NTEXT bulk insert example | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | how-to; bridge has no bulk_insert. |
| 322 | Large varchar/nvarchar bulk insert | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | (covered above) |
| 319 | Insert into TEXT column | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | how-to; bridge can `INSERT` via `query`/`execute`. |
| 311 | Bulk Insert: Allow column names | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | Feature for when bridge implements bulk_insert. |
| 307 | Bulk insert with datetime field | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | how-to / tiberius-specific. |
| 302 | Bulk Copy Options | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | Feature for future bulk_insert. |
| 373 | Date issue in bulk insert (target schema) | ✅ | via [#53](../../issues/53) (PR [#84](../../pull/84)) | tiberius-only. |

> **✅ Bridge update**: `Client::bulk_insert` (BCP) shipped in [#53](../../issues/53) via PR [#84](../../pull/84) and [PR #86](../../pull/86) (Apache Arrow `RecordBatch` input under the `arrow` feature). All BCP-related rows above are now covered.

## E. Type Conversion / `FromSql` / `ToSql` / `IntoSql`

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 401 | Implement `IntoSql` for `rust_decimal` | 🟡 | tracked in [#87](../../issues/87) — `ToSql for rust_decimal::Decimal` missing | **Check**: bridge's `ToSql for Decimal`. Probably already has. |
| 277 | `IntoSql` impl missing for `time` crate | ✅ | [#67](../../issues/67) — `time` crate `ToSql` | Bridge added chrono ToSql in PR #23; `time` crate is a separate gap. |
| 244 | `impl IntoSql<'a>` in `.bind()` method | ⚪ | — | Bridge has no `Query::bind` builder; N/A. |
| 257 | Can't get `geography` type | 🟡 | tracked in [#69](../../issues/69) | **Repro**: bridge `ColumnValues` — does it have a Geography variant? Likely no. |
| 354 | jiff crate support | ✅ | [#68](../../issues/68) — `jiff` support | Feature. Mirror chrono/time impls. |
| 277 | (dup) | ✅ | [#67](../../issues/67) — `time` crate `ToSql` | — |
| 401 | (dup) | 🟡 | tracked in [#87](../../issues/87) — `ToSql for rust_decimal::Decimal` missing | — |
| 169 | Owned variants on `FromSql` for `String`/`Vec` | ✅ | [#40](../../issues/40) (PR [#43](../../pull/43)) | **Check**: bridge `FromSql<String>` / `FromSql<Vec<u8>>`. |
| 367 | `sendStringParametersAsUnicode` connection property | ✅ | [#49](../../issues/49) (PR [#50](../../pull/50)) | Feature: control NVARCHAR-vs-VARCHAR encoding for string params. |
| 334 | Why tinyint converted to u8? | ⚪ | — | Tiberius design — TDS TinyInt is unsigned 1-byte. Not a bug. |
| 216 | Distinguishing `Intn` for bigint vs int | ⚪ | — | how-to / FromSql usage. |
| 219 | Case insensitive `row.get()` | ✅ | [#41](../../issues/41) (PR [#43](../../pull/43)) — `get_ci`/`try_get_ci` | Feature gap. **Check** if bridge `Row::get(name)` is case-sensitive. Probably yes. |
| 221 | f64::NAN insert into decimal column | ✅ | regression test in PR [#51](../../pull/51) | **Repro**: send NaN as `f64` param to bridge — should error gracefully, not corrupt protocol. |
| 282 | Binding string adds quotation marks (with proc) | ✅ | regression test in PR [#51](../../pull/51) | **Repro**: call a SP via bridge with a `&str` param. |
| 278 | Dynamic interaction with query results | ⚪ | — | how-to / design discussion. |

## F. Connectivity / Connection Setup

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 414 | Client hostname in `LoginMessage` | ✅ | [#46](../../issues/46) (PR [#50](../../pull/50)) — `Config::client_name` | **Check**: does bridge send a real hostname in Login7? It likely uses `localhost`. |
| 386 | smol 2.0 incompat with `sql-browser-smol` | 🟢 | — | tiberius-runtime. Bridge is tokio-only. |
| 360 | Timeout connecting over VPN | ⚪ | — | Diagnostic / network. |
| 345 | Dynamic ports in Docker | ✅ | SSRP supported (PR [#27](../../pull/27)) | Use SSRP / instance_name. Bridge already supports SSRP (PR #27). |
| 313 | "Key-value pairs must be separated by a `;`" parsing | 🟢 | — | tiberius ADO-string parser. Bridge has its own `Config` builder. |
| 329 | Update `tokio_rustls` 0.24 → 0.25 | 🟢 | — | tiberius dep. N/A. |
| 337 | MultiSubnetFailover support | ✅ | [#61](../../issues/61) — MultiSubnetFailover | Feature. mssql-tds may have routing redirect; MSF is separate. |
| 348 | Send ReadOnlyIntent (already merged in tiberius PR #297) | ✅ | `Config::readonly` (PR [#24](../../pull/24)) | Bridge already has `Config::readonly` (PR #24). |
| 335 | Read-only routing examples | ⚪ | — | how-to. |
| 375 | azure-sql-edge on macOS hangs | ⚪ | environment-specific (azure-sql-edge on macOS) | **Repro**: try connecting bridge to an azure-sql-edge container. |
| 198 | Check if TCP connection is alive | ✅ | [#44](../../issues/44) (PR [#45](../../pull/45)) — `Client::ping()` | Feature: `Client::ping` or `is_connected`. |
| 299 | Reset connection (`sp_reset_connection`) | 🟡 | `ping()` shipped via [#44](../../issues/44); `reset_session()` tracked in [#52](../../issues/52) | Feature for pooling. |
| 301 | How do I call `ping`? | ✅ | [#44](../../issues/44) — `Client::ping()` | how-to. |
| 131 | Named pipes support | ✅ | [#60](../../issues/60) — Named pipe transport | Feature. mssql-tds may not support named pipes. |
| 53 | Other connection methods than TCP | ✅ | [#60](../../issues/60) — Named pipe transport | Same theme. |
| 125 | COUNT() fails on GCP | ⚪ | — | Environment issue. |
| 70 | diesel + tiberius | ⚪ | — | Out of scope. |

## G. API Surface / Ergonomics

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|

| 397 | Expose `BaseMetaDataColumn` & `TypeInfo` | ✅ | [#63](../../issues/63) — column metadata | Bridge's `Column` already exposes type/precision/scale to some extent — verify completeness. |
| 403 | `BaseMetaDataColumn` does not retrieve Identity flag | ✅ | [#63](../../issues/63) — column metadata | **Check**: bridge's column metadata — does it carry IDENTITY/nullable/size? |
| 217 | Column nullable/size/scale enhancement | ✅ | [#63](../../issues/63) — column metadata | Same theme. |
| 383 | Constructing a `Row` for tests | 🔵 | — | Bridge `Row::from_schema` is `pub` already; verify usable for tests. |
| 262 | Make `QueryIdx` public | ✅ | [#39](../../issues/39) (PR [#43](../../pull/43)) — `ColumnIndex` public | **Check**: bridge has `ColumnIndex` trait — public? |
| 258 | How to write wrapper for try_get? | ⚪ | — | how-to (related to #262). |
| 336 | `Config::trust_cert_ca` should take `Into<PathBuf>` | ✅ | `Config::trust_cert_ca` exists (PR [#22](../../pull/22)) | Bridge already added `trust_cert_ca` (PR #22) — check signature. |
| 382 | Raw identifier prefixes (r#) should be ignored | ⚪ | N/A — bridge has no `IntoRow` derive macro | `IntoRow`/derive macros — bridge has none yet. |
| 30 | Statements (prepared) | 🟡 | tracked in [#56](../../issues/56) — Prepared Statements | Feature: prepared statements. mssql-tds may support `sp_prepare`/`sp_execute`. |

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 380 | `QueryStream::into_results` doesn't return correct number | ✅ | regression test in PR [#51](../../pull/51) | **Repro**: bridge `QueryResult::into_results` — empty SELECTs preserved? |
| 371 | QueryStream returns 1 row, ends with more remaining | ✅ | regression test in PR [#51](../../pull/51) | **Repro**: bridge has streaming via `into_row_stream` (PR #29). |
| 365 | Cannot return `RowStream` from a function (lifetime tied to connection) | 🔵 | — | Bridge has same architecture; design issue. Could be addressed via owned stream. |
| 79 | Cancel safety on futures | 🟡 | tracked in [#88](../../issues/88) — cancel-safety audit | Bridge inherits this from mssql-tds — needs investigation. |
| 300 | Cancel is not safe (tokio::time::timeout corrupts state) | 🟡 | tracked in [#88](../../issues/88) — cancel-safety audit | **Repro**: timeout a `client.simple_query` and re-use. |
| 160 | `rows_affected` length incorrect when table has trigger | ✅ | regression test in PR [#51](../../pull/51) | **Repro**: bridge's `ExecuteResult::rows_affected`. |
| 157 | "IN" prepared statement | ⚪ | — | how-to (TDS doesn't support array params). |

## I. Logging / Diagnostics

| # | Title | Status | Bridge | Notes |

## Execution Strategy

The 101 issues collapse to **~25 tractable Tier 1+2 work items** for the bridge. Many are clusters that share a single fix (e.g., the four NTLM-on-Linux issues all become one `AuthMethod::ntlm` feature).

I'll fan out the **Tier 1 + Tier 2** work to background agents in parallel. Each agent:
1. Repros in `/Users/saurabh/work/mssql-tiberius-bridge` against `10.0.0.21,1434` (or unit test where possible).
2. If the issue exists, files a duplicate issue in `saurabh500/mssql-tiberius-bridge` linking the upstream tiberius issue.
3. Submits a PR with a minimal fix and tests.

Each agent owns one tiberius issue or a tightly-related cluster.

### ⚪ Not filed / closed as out-of-scope

The bridge supports **SQL Server 2016 and newer**. Issues that exist only to
support older releases (2014, 2012, 2008 R2, 2008, 2005, 2000) are out of
scope and not tracked.

| Tib# | Reason |
|------|--------|
| #364 | Environment-specific (macOS 15 + **SQL Server 2014**) — out of support; not tracked. |
| #344 | **SQL Server 2000** invalid token — out of support; not tracked. |
| #381 | openssl backend for TLS 1.0/1.1 — only needed for **SQL Server 2008 R2 / 2012** (out of support). Bridge issue #70 closed as wontfix. |
| #218 | tiberius 0.9 crashing on macOS — old tiberius version; N/A. |
| #375 | Environment-specific (azure-sql-edge on macOS) — needs that exact combo to repro. |
| #343 | Bridge's libgssapi dependency already includes the upstream fix. |
| #382 | N/A — bridge has no `IntoRow` derive macro. |
| #263 | N/A — bridge's `FromSql for i32` already widens from `SmallInt`/`TinyInt`; null handled via `Option<i32>`. |

### Totals (as of 2026-05-10)

- **22 shipped** (PRs landed or issues closed) covering ~36 distinct tiberius issues.
- **13 open** tracking issues (4 just filed: #87, #88, #89, #90).
- **1 closed wontfix** for legacy SQL Server (#70).
- **8 explicitly skipped** with rationale.
- ⇒ **44 bridge work items** classified from this triage.
